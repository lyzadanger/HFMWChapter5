Chapter 5, Step 1
=================

This step is primarily concerned with getting WURFL up and running and looking at all of the capabilities of a device by User Agent lookup. WURFL ships with a simple example page that has similar functionality, but this version shows more (that is, all) capabilities and is a complete HTML page. It's also responsive and should work on phones.

The challenge here is not so much with the specifics of getting the HTML, CSS and PHP all nice, but with getting WURFL set up. More detailed instructions can be found in [step_2](../step 2).

Step 1 is the "start" point of the long exercise in which the reader constructs a page to explore the WURFL capabilities for a given user agent (by default the current browser's user agent). Step 2 is the "end" point of this exercise.
