Chapter 5, Step 3 (test_classes)
=================

*Note*: Steps 3 and 4 are collapsed into one longer exercise in the reader edition
(i.e. the edition you get when running the build script)
In the reader edition, a single folder `device_classes` is created, with step 3 represented as `test_classes` in a subdirectory therein (step 4 is in `adapt_content` under `device_classes`).

### Device Class Construction and Detection
In this step, we're using WURFL as the technical piece to define some device classes (logical groups of capabilities and values). The goal is to create some device class testing rules and be able to assign devices to the correct device class via user agent.
