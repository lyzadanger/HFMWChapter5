Chapter 5, Step 4 (adapt_content)
=================

*Note*: Steps 3 and 4 are collapsed into one longer exercise in the reader edition
(i.e. the edition you get when running the build script)
In the reader edition, a single folder `device_classes` is created, with step 4 represented as `adapt_content` in a subdirectory therein (step 3 is in `test_classes` under `device_classes`).

### Device Class-Based Content Adaptation
Use the device classes defined in step 3 to adapt content for devices. Adaptation is handled by the use of conditional statements in the index.php file, which include selective inclusion of different stylesheets.
